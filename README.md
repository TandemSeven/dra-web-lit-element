# dra-web-lit-element

The app displays current and forecasted weather for your current location, allowing you to search weather for another location by zip code.

Data is powered by a few free/open APIs (IP API to convert IP to Lat/Long Coordinates, Zippopotamus to convert Coordinates to Zip Code, and Weather.gov for all weather-related data).
